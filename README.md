📧 Spam Mail Detection using Machine Learning
This project aims to enhance email security by automatically classifying messages as Spam (unsolicited/malicious) or Ham (legitimate). Using Natural Language Processing (NLP) and supervised learning algorithms, the model analyzes text patterns to protect users from phishing and junk mail.

🚀 Key Features
Text Preprocessing: Tokenization, stop-word removal, and Lemmatization.

Vectorization: Implementation of TF-IDF or CountVectorizer to convert text to numerical data.

Multiple Algorithms: Comparison between Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, and SVM.

Performance Metrics: Detailed evaluation using Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and F1-Score.
